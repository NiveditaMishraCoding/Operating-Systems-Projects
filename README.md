# Operating Systems Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of projects focusing on various aspects of operating systems, including system monitoring, file system implementation, memory management, thread scheduling, and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. Each project is designed to provide practical experience with core operating system concepts.

## Projects Overview

- **Project 5: System Performance Monitor** - A real-time system monitoring tool that displays memory performance statistics, similar to the Unix `top` command.
- **Project 4: Key/Value File System** - Implements file system concepts such as kernel-level file caching and I/O operations.
- **Project 3: Storage Class Memory Manager** - Focuses on managing storage class memory, emphasizing efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Project 2: Userspace Dynamic Thread Scheduler** - A library for dynamic thread scheduling in userspace, similar to POSIX pthreads, enabling cooperative concurrency.
- **Project 1: JIT Compiled Expression Evaluator** - Evaluates expressions at runtime using JIT compilation techniques for optimized performance.
